# tap3xml
tap3xml is a both directions XML&lt;->TAP3 converter made in C++. It will convert the files according to the ASN.1 structure defined by the GSM Association.  Unfortunately, because of lack of resources, I am not able to test tap3xml properly. If you like to contribute with the improvement of the tool, you can send me your ideas/comments/bugs.
